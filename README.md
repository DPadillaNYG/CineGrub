### Assignment

I was tasked along with my team members to come up with a website idea and have a
working MVP ready within two weeks for presentation. I can confidently say that
we have created a fully functional MVP within the deadline and met all of our stretch
goals as well. I personally came up with the website proposal of CineGrub after
exploring potential APIs for inspiration. I kept coming back to the MovieDB and Zomato
API. As a moviegoer, I enjoy being able to take my wife out to both a movie and
dinner. And so the idea was to make both of these services come together and feel
seamless within a centralized search engine.

### Skills Learned

I pushed myself harder than I ever had before in this project and learned so much along the way.
With being only a third way done with the class, I can honestly say I feel super comfortable
in the role of a Front-end Web Developer. Here are some of the skills I learned during the course
of this project.

- Integration w/ **new** Third-party Libraries (anime.js, Formspree, SweetAlert2)
- Google Maps (Geocoding API, Maps Static API, Maps URLs)
- CSS Flip Animation
- ZIP Code Validation
- Dynamic Contact Form
- Preloader
- Resolving Merge Conflicts
- Reviewing Pull Requests
- Connecting Custom URL to GitHub Pages

### My Contributions

I was in charge of the overall CSS for every aspect of the website. Creating the layout, the animations,
dynamic elements, API formatting, and typography. Aside from the visual aspect of the website, I created
the functionality for the submit button, the loading icon, Google Maps API with AJAX, fixing user
authentication bugs, and enhancing the Zomato & MovieDB APIs with star ratings using Font Awesome 5.

### Comments

I'm very pleased with how the final product came out. I got to collaborate with team members of unique
personalities and skillsets. There was alot more I wish we could've done like creating a social media
presence on other social platforms. There are however understandable limitations to the project as well.
Because it serves as a portfolio project made by aspiring developers, high traffic volumes would be
detrimental to the Google Maps feature which depends of dozens of call requests per search that cost
money.
